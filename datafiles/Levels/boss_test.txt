//T(new tempo, steps to get there)
//bps(new beats per step) e.g. bps(1) sets 1 beat (quarter note) per step (line), bps(0.5) -> half note; bps(2) -> eighth note; bps(4) -> sixteenth note; etc.

//if grid type is planar, this is the distance from center.
//0 is completely off the screen, 1 is maximally close.
//a good middle ground is 0.8 .
